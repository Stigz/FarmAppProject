# FarmAppProject
This is a Farm App for Pomona's Farm Manager to use as a digital resource for their work.
They will be able to record the crop histories for the beds in the farm.

The Farm app is built hierarchical, like the Farm itself
First a user selects a section, then a bed, then a crop, then a variety.

Features include: Planting/harvest dates, weight of harvest, harvest history for each bed, saved crops, saved varieties, notes for each harvest.
